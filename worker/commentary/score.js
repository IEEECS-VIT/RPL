    "GOOOAAAAL!! Beautiful foot work from /f. He took the ball past two defenders with ease and drove it low. The goalkeeper had no chance.",

    "/f scores!! The winger ran down the flank and smoothly cut in before firing it to the top corner.",
    "It had to be /f, didn't it! They are shambolic defensively from a corner and the forward easily pulls away from his man towards the far post. Somehow, he has the space to sidefoot the ball home. Clinical finish as ever, but he should not have had it that easy!",
    "Once again, The attacking team were quickest to react inside the area. /f sees a snap shot saved but he's onto the rebound in a flash, prodding it into the back of the net!",

    "/f races past his man down the left side of the box and cuts onto his right foot before firing a powerful shot into the back of the net!",
    "THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!! What a splendid bicycle kick from /f. Perfect cross from the winger and an even better finish. This is unreal.",
    "WONDER GOAL!! /f sees /G off his line and takes a volley from the halfway line and the goalkeeper is left fumbling as the ball goes in. Splendid work.",
    "/f SCORES!! And what a beautiful one at that. /f came in running and headed the cross over /G. The ball dipped just in time and went in to give them a goal.",
    "WONDERFUL GOAL!! /f received the ball outside the box from /m lifted it up, turned and took it on the volley straight for the top right corner.",
    "/f HAS DONE IT AGAIN!! He challenged /M for the ball at the halfway line and dribbled past 5 opposition players before getting clear of the goalkeeper and easily touches the ball into the goal. ",
    "WHAT A RUN THAT WAS!! /D was left chasing as /f took a heavy first touch to get clear of him and reached the ball as /D looked. /f further nutmegged /G for a brilliant finish.",
    "STUPID GOAL TO GIVE AWAY!! /G gets under pressure from /f who then challenges for the ball, gets it and shoots it into the net as the goalkeeper is left fumbling on the ground.",
    "STUNNING GOAL!! /f just backheels it into the net from an accurate pass from /m.",
    "AND IT GOES IN!! The knuckleball again. /f calmly puts the ball down for the freekick, takes his run up and shoots it over the wall towards the near post. There's nothing the goalkeeper could do.",
    "BRILLIANT FREE KICK!! /f just curles it over the wall into the bottom corner."
