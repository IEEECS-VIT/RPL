    "/F spins round /m with ease before sending the ball out to /M, who then curls a cross into the heart of the penalty area. It's half cleared by /d, but only as far as /M, who fires a first-time volley that /m does well to get in the way of.",

    "/d blocks /F's shot. It was going straight towards the goal.",

    "/F tries his luck with a volley but the goalkeeper is there solid as a rock to block his shot.",
    "Fine piece of defending from /d. He risks his body on the line and dives in front of /F's shot.",
    "Brilliant attacking play and would've resulted in a goal but for /d's block.",
    "Some quite stupendous goalkeeping! /m makes an ONSIDE run down the left and stings the palm of the keeper with a powerful shot. That first save wasn't that remarkable, but what caught the eye was his quick rise to stick up an arm and block /m's rebound! That's what you call reflexes!",
    "/g DOES WELL! /M has certainly made an impact as he links with /F quite tantalizingly. The playmaker has time and space to line up a shot in the box, but he can't beat /g with the outside of his boot! Great save!"
