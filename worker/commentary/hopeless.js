    "/m picks up the ball on the halfway line and whips a brilliant pass over the top of the defence and onto the chest of /f, but the striker's first touch is poor and gifts possession back to the defending team, much to their relief.",

    "Stupid play from /g!! The goalkeeper barely manages to clear his lines. What was he thinking coming out with the ball like that.",

    "Wasted possession. Shot straight into the keeper's hands."
