    "And there goes the whistle for half time. The teams are level. The managers will be having a word with their players to try and gain the lead in the second half",
    "The referee has blown for half time. It was an interesting half with plenty of shots but neither team has managed to capitalise on the chances. Let's hope we see some goals in the scond half.",
    "The half comes to an end. Only one team has had chances but they haven't been able to move ahead yet. It'll be interesting to see if they change their approach in the second half.",
    "What a Half!! Full of goals. And yet both teams are level.",
    "Referee blows his whistle and the half comes to an end. Both teams are level at the break.",
    "There is the whistle for half time. We saw one team creating all the chances and gaining a much deserved lead. the trailing team need to get back in their game.",
    "The first half is over and surprisingly the dominating team is trailing. They had plenty of chances but couldn't convert them. Let's see if they improve in the final third.",
    "A thoroughly entertaining first half and one team heads into it with the lead. However, with the game as close as it is at the moment, anything could happen when the two teams re-emerge!"
