    "It's over. It has been an amazing contest with plenty of goals. One team came out on top with 3 points while the other team will hope to catch up in the coming matches.",
    "What a contest this has been. We saw one team dominate through the entire game and get the well deserved 3 points. Until next time.",
    "It's done. The final whistle has been blown. This game definitely showed that football is a game of 2 halves. We saw one team dominate through the first half but the other team came back in the dying moments of the match to take all 3 points. What a comeback."
