    "/d makes a fine challenge on /M.",
    "Fantastic tackle by /d! /M sends a quick pass into the path of /M from the edge of the box. It almost meets the youngster in front of goal but the centre-back is just about able to get a toe on it to send it away from the striker.",
    "/M wins the ball from the feet of /m before firing a long pass into the path of /F. The forward does well to hold up the ball whilst waiting for reinforcements to arrive, and eventually offloads it to /M on the right flank. The midfielder battles with /d on the wing but comes out second best, allowing the centre back to clear the danger after a few nervy moments.",
    "Brilliant defending! They had pushed so many bodies forward that they're left with only /d at the back, but the defender does extremely well to halt a three-man counter attack before his teammates rush back to help regain possession before the attacking team is able to get a shot away.",
    "Beautiful piece of defending from /d to stop /F.",
    "Perfectly timed tackle by /d. A little later and he'd have given away a penalty.",
    "Perfectly timed tackle by /d. A little later and he'd have given away a free kick in a dangerous position.",
    "/d comes in confidently and dispossesses /F before he has a chance at the goal.",
    "The defender saves them again. The cross came in from the wing but /d was confident and headed it out of danger.",
    "/d saw the move and came in with a well timed challenge to stop /F from taking the shot.",
    "/m tackles /M in the center of the pitch and now his team can set out on an attack.",
    "/m gets dispossessed easily by /M but chases him down and gets the ball with a fine tackle.",
    "The defender comes in risking his body and wins the ball in a dangerous area."
